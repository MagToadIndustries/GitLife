GitLife

Hooking up the time machine to your entire git history

Assuming that your `git init` was run on your birth, you still don't have access to your entire history.  Rather than living only with the choices you made, GitLife™ lets your checkout your other selves, where you made other choices.

*We suggest only using `checkout` most of the time*.  Although GitLife™ gives you access to all git commands to traverse your life's history, the danger of overwriting is always existant using `rebase` or working in detached HEAD.  Additionally, since all your choices will be committed (as two or more branches at the decision point), there should, with infinite probability, always be a version of you which simply did not make the choice you are looking to change, but made all other choices the same as you did.  Find and checkout that branch.
